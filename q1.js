/*CHALLENGE 1
Have another setting for age. By default the age is set to 19, but the user can set the age to another desired drinking age by using the command "change age". This also means the age for notification needs to correspond to this setting

CHALLENGE 2
Make a VIP setting, and allow the user to type in an index that corresponds to the VIP. By default VIP is false, but the user can write "make vip", to assign a number to the VIP setting. The user can also write "cancel vip" to turn vip back to false.

When VIP is not false, when the notify function is called, only the VIP will get notified. Everybody else will get console logged "sorry the store is not available today."

/*
You are making a simple drinking store application. There are 2 parts to this

1) You need the organizer to register the age of each customer coming in. You will do this using an array.
2) Depending on the "settings" of the store, if alcohol is true that means it's adults only meaning anyone under the age of 19 are not allowed to drink and should be notified. 
When the alcohol setting is true, if the age in the registry is 19 or above console log "You are allow to drink in here." otherwise "You are not allowed in here.". When the setting is false, console log "Everyone is welcome in here!"


/*
Plan

1. registry
If alcohol is "true"
Asking user What is your age? to put their age in array
- age <= 19 console log "You are not allow to drink in here. Also get notified
- age >= 19 console log "You are allow to drink in here.

2. Toggle
If alcohol is "False"
- console log "Everyone is welcome in here!"

3. Notify
 notify all  the user age that is not allow to drink
